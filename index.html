        <p> Welcome to Riss's Programming Portfolio which I will use to document my development as a computer scientist. My name is Riss I am a freshman at the University of Rhode Island, I currently double major in Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering. I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in both. I will update this page as my skills in Computer Science develop. I struggled with deciding on a double major as I orginally was in the International Engineering Program studying German. I however felt that Computer Science would help my career goals better. </p>
