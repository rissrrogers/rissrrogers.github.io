        <p>  My name is Riss I am a freshman at the University of Rhode Island, I currently double major in Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering. I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in both. I originally struggled with deciding on a double major as I orginally was in the International Engineering Program studying German. I however felt that Computer Science would help my career goals better and so I changed my major. </p>
